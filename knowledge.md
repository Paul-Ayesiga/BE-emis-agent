# LangGraph Agentic System — Implementation Prompt

## Goal

Build an LLM-based agentic system using **LangGraph** (custom agent flow, no React agent) and integrate it with **FASTMCP-OPENAPI** tools.

## Reference

Use the architecture from the attached diagram: **EMIS System Architecture Overview**.

---

## Core Requirements

### 1. LangGraph Flow
- Use LangGraph's `StateGraph` to define control flow.
- Include:
  - `Checkpointing` mechanism
  - `SQLiteMemory` for session persistence
  - `Task Queue` for multithreaded task execution from multiple users
- Enable **multi-user, multi-session support**

### 2. Agent Behavior
- Define a LangGraph agent that:
  - Accepts user input
  - Decides control flow using an LLM (e.g., Gemini)
  - Selects and calls tools (via tool-calling)
  - Handles self-termination when task is complete

### 3. Tool Execution
- Use a **Tool Execution Engine** that routes requests to **FASTMCP API Tools**.
- Tools should be:
  - OpenAPI-compatible
  - Registered using LangChain’s `@tool` decorators or equivalent bindings
  - Return structured outputs
- Integrate **Gemini** for natural language interaction and reasoning.

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop
- Implement escalation paths for human approval (triggered by LLM decision).
- Allow human input to update or override the state when required.

## Advanced Features

### ✅ Memory
- **Short-term memory** for within-session reasoning
- **Checkpointing + SQLiteMemory** for persistence

### ✅ Subgraphs
- Use LangGraph **subgraphs** to modularize:
  - Pre-processing
  - LLM planning
  - Tool interaction
  - Human-in-the-loop approval

### ✅ Parallelism
- Use LangGraph’s `send()` API to:
  - Parallelize multi-user task execution
  - Enable concurrent tool calls where applicable

### ✅ Reflection (Optional)
- Allow LLM to self-correct via:
  - Error feedback (e.g., API failure)
  - Task evaluation loop
